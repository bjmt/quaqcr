Description: A wrapper around the 'quaqc' program. 'quaqc' allows for
    ATAC-seq-specific quality control and read filtering of NGS data with
    minimal processing time and extremely low memory overhead. Any number of
    samples can be processed, using multiple threads if desired. 'quaqc' outputs
    a comprehensive set of aligned read metrics, including alignment size,
    fragment size, percent duplicates, mapq scores, read depth, GC content, and
    others. Although designed for ATAC-seq data, 'quaqc' can also be used for
    other unspliced DNA-seq experiments (such as ChIP-seq) as many of the
    metrics are related to genereal sequencing quality. This R package also
    provides additional utilities for custom analyses and plotting of 'quaqc'
    results.
